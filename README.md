## What the Project is.

In my project for graphics programming I decided to make the classic game **Brick Breaker** the addicting game where you bounce a ball off a paddle to break blocks and chase high scores. I felt this game would show off the collision detection, user input and various other things that i have learned in the semester

## How the Game Works and Plays

The game starts with the ball on the paddle you then press the **SPACE** key to launch the ball as the ball hits a brick your score will increase by 10 until all the blocks are gone then you win. You are also given 3 lives if you fail to hit the ball with the paddle you will lose a life when all 3 lives are gone you lose

## Sources for Some of the Code

The source I used to allow me to pass the js file to the html file = http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11566984/how-to-pass-a-variable-from-a-html-form-to-a-js-file ,
The source I used for a javascript alert = http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_popup.asp ,
The rest of the code I had done during the semester and it was just a matter of adapting the code to suit my project and the design i wanted to implement

## End Result of the Project

After the end of the project i believe i have become much better at general Javascript. Also solving problems that occur and understanding the errors that the console will throw at you and figuring out how to fix them
